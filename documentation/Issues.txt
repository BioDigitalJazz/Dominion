Issues:

Feast: can only gain non-Action cards

1) Messages for Played Action Cards
  Mine (done)
  Feast (wait for fix. separate functions for click actions)

(maybe) DOM manipulation in global functions instead of Game.func()

2) Multi-Purpose Button in play-prompt area
2.2) Highlighting cards to discard

3) game.js | playCard function
(see comment in the function)



** Phantom problem
(Firefox only)
  "game is undefined"
game.js, line 151
  if (parseInt(playerID) !== game.currentPlayerIndex){
