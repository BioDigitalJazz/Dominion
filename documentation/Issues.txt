Issues:

1) Buying cards and gaining cards both use Player.gainCard()
How to differentiate them in the log?

2) game.js | playCard function
(see comment in the function)



** Phantom problem
(Firefox only)
  "game is undefined"
game.js, line 151
  if (parseInt(playerID) !== game.currentPlayerIndex){
