Issues:

Bugfix
1) Message display after playing an action changes to
"Buy a card, ..."
but if a Village card has been played there should be >1 actions

1) Messages for Played Action Cards
  Moneylender
  Witch
  Moat

  Adventurer (no need)
  Feast (done)
  Mine (done)


(maybe) DOM manipulation in global functions instead of Game.func()

2) Multi-Purpose Button in play-prompt area
2.2) Highlighting cards to discard

3) Multiple games



** Phantom problem
(Firefox only)
  "game is undefined"
game.js, line 151
