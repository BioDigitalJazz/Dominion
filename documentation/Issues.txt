Issues:

1) After playing an Action card, the player can no longer click on Treasure Cards to move them to the play area => Coins remain 0 => Can't buy

2) Buying cards and gaining cards both use Player.gainCard()
How to differentiate them in the log?

3) game.js | playCard function
(see comment in the function)
