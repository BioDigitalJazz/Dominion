Issues:

1) Messages for Played Action Cards  
  Witch
  Moat

  Adventurer (no need)
  Feast (done)
  Mine (done)
  Moneylender (done)


(maybe) DOM manipulation in global functions instead of Game.func()

2) Multi-Purpose Button in play-prompt area
2.2) Highlighting cards to discard

3) Multiple games

4) End/save game



** Phantom problem
(Firefox only)
  "game is undefined"
