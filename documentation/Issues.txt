Issues:

1) After playing an Action card, the player can no longer click on Treasure Cards to move them to the play area => Coins remain 0 => Can't buy

2) Buying cards and gaining cards both use Player.gainCard()
How to differentiate them in the log?

3) game.js | playCard function
(see comment in the function)

4) player.js | Player.prototype.displayDiscard 
  discardPile top card stays for 600 millisecond then gets shuffled into deck
=> how to make it more obvious that shuffling is taking place

** Phantom problem
(Firefox only)
  "game is undefined"
game.js, line 151
  if (parseInt(playerID) !== game.currentPlayerIndex){
